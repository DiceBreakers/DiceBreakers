            <h2><b>About Dice Breakers:</b></h2>							
            <p>Hmm. Well I originally had this section hidden in the HTML, but apparently google does not approve of that? I don't know. I thought it was more fun that way.
            Anyway, my website doesn't have very many words (outside the database), but I'm told I need to add some so the robots that control the Internet know what happens here.
            Dice Breakers started as game I made up that used a google sheet and some dice to pick activities when friends and I were indecisive.
            At first it was mostly activity based, then a friend suggested adding topics of conversation to the list of activities, which was a great addition!
            Anyway, I couldn't sleep one night and was writing questions to add to the game, then the name D(ice) Breakers came to mind.
            I guess I liked the name enough to learn some web development and turn it from a Google Sheets game to a website?</p>
            <br>
            <p>My goal is to provide a platform for positive, thought provoking, or otherwise meaningful conversations. In person, online, wherever works to get people to connect and think a little bit more!
            Please, share this game with your friends! I hope I've added enough initial prompts to be a functional foundation. And ideally, eventually, this website is known to people outside my family and prompts are generated more organically.
            I'm by no means an experienced developer, so I'm figuring things out as I go. I think I've done okay, but if you have suggestions, I'm very receptive to ideas!</p>
