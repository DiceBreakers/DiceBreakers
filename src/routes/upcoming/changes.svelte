            <h2><b>Upcoming Changes:</b></h2>							
            <p>Hello, and thanks for your interest in upcoming changes to Dice Breakers! This site is in active development by a hobby developer. I have (or should say, had) no experience with web development, this is simply a passion project and I'm learning as I go. If you notice something that could be better, please email <a href="mailto:suggestions@DiceBreakers.app">Suggestions@DiceBreakers.app!</a></p>
            <h2><b>Coming Sooner:</b></h2>
                My initial vision is coming together, but I have several pieces of functionaulty I still need to build out.
                <br> 
                <ul><b>Author Details -</b> Right now a conversation shows the author, but I want you to be able to click their name and view other conversations/comments by them. This should help identify authors you want to favorite.</ul>
                <ul><b>Comment Functionality -</b> I want to build out the functionality on comments pages so people can like or hide comments, or view/follow authors, etc, from the comments section.</ul>
                <ul><b>Dice Enhancement -</b> As much as I enjoy the little dice animation my best friend found, I want to learn a little 3D modeling and create an interactive dice that you can roll/spin. It may not have any practical purpose, but I think it could be fun to build and hopefully people find it amusing!</ul>
                <ul><b>Sort Options -</b> Currently, rolling is random outside of the filter options you see. But, ideally, the user base for this site grows and new conversations/likes allow me to do a “Recents” or “Best of” sort options. And as the stronger conversation starters get votes, I can use that info to hide the less engaging prompts. I'll leave a “random” option for people who want to ignore scores.</ul>
            <h2><b>Coming Later:</b></h2>
                Once I finish my initial vision, I'd like to let the site's development be user-guided. I'll open up comments on this page and I'd like users to post their ideas and let the community vote and discuss their favorite suggestions. I've been on the Internet too long to say I'll do everything the Internet tells me to do - I don't want this site turning into the wild west - but within reason, I'd love to incorporate user ideas. 
            <h2><b>In My Dreams:</b></h2>
                <p>This is currently pure fantasy, but I've always been a fan of direct communication so people aren't surprised when I do something. What do I want to happen with this website? Well, step one is see if I'm able to get the website to be self-sustaining. So far, I've spent about $1,500 for a website that has no revenue source, and that number is only going to grow as I continue to advertise. As much as I enjoy building this website, I'm just a regular guy with no investors and I don't plan to subsidize it forever, so two things are going to happen: Ads are going to be enabled, and I'll introduce a paid membership for people who hate ads. I wanted to do a $1 monthly subscription, but credit card processing fees make that price structure difficult. My current thinking is $2/month, $9/six months, or $12/year.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have no clue what amount of revenue to expect from these changes. I know a lot of people hate ads, and a lot of people hate monthly subscriptions, so maybe I turn these on and I'm still burning money on hosting every month. But, this is my fantasy section, so let's assume profitability! I really want two things in life - I want the time and resources that allow me to be creative, and I want to be able to help people. In light of these goals, Dice Breakers has pledged that 50% of profits will be donated to charity. The National Alliance on Mental Illness will receive 20% of the charity pool, while Dice Breaker's members will have the oppurtunity to vote on how the remaining 80% is allocated.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While I'm treating this as my public day dream journal, here is how I picture it working. From January through November, anyone who has spent a dollar will have access to a Charity discussion board where people can discuss and like their favorite charities. Come December, I'll open a poll with the most liked charities throughout the discussion months. Then members will be given 1 vote per dollar spent and there be a friendly battle of the charities. Now that I type this out, I think I'm trying to gamify charity?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Oh, while I'm rambling, I could set up a Printify account to sell merch... Would anyone want a Dice Breakers hoodie? Or fannie pack? Maybe let merch sales be 80% profit to charity... If anyone wanted to help spread awareness for me, I'd want more of that to go towards charity.</p>
