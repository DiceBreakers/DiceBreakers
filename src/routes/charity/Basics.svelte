    <p>Dice Breakers has organized itself to run itself as a for-profit organization with a strong charitable focus. In that effort, it has pledged to donate a minimum of 50% of all profits to charities, with some items in the <a href="https://shop.dicebreakers.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Merch Shop</b></a> being 75% profit to charity.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Dice Breakers uses two buckets for directing charitable funds:</p>
    <br>
        <li>Half of all profit will go towards that member's "Default Charity" chosen while registering. Options include <a href="https://donate.nami.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The National Alliance on Mental Illness,</b></a> <a href="https://eji.org/?campaign=447413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Equal Justice Initiative,</b></a> <a href="https://jedfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Jed Foundation,</b></a> <a href="https://www.stjude.org/donate/donate-to-st-jude.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>St. Jude's,</b></a> <a href="https://donate.catf.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Clean Air Task Force</b></a>, or <a href="https://secure.aspca.org/donate/donate"><b>The ASPCA.</b></a> These are 6 organizations that I believe support meaningful causes and shape a better world. These charities will be added to or rotated as I see what organizations are meaningful to other members.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The remaining half (or all profit from non-members) will be decided by a yearly Dice Breakers member vote. Members can discuss and promote their favorite charities from January through November. Then in December, a list of the top ranked charities will be published and members will be alloted votes equal to the number of dollars spent at Dice Breakers throughout the year. Polling will remain open until the third Friday in December, then the results are tallied and funds are distributed accordingly.</li>
