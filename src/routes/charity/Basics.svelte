    <p>Dice Breakers has organized itself to run itself as a for-profit organization with a strong charitable focus. In that effort, it has pledged to donate a minimum of 50% of all profits to charities, with some items in the <a href="https://shop.dicebreakers.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Merch Shop</b></a> being 75% profit to charity.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Dice Breakers uses three buckets for directing charitable funds:</p>
    <br>
        <li>20% of charitable funds are allocated to <a href="https://donate.nami.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The National Alliance on Mental Illness.</b></a> This charity was chosen as a particularly meaningful organization that Dice Breakers wanted to support.</li>
        <br>
        <li>20% of charitable funds raised by members are directed to that member's chosen "Default Charity". Choose between <a href="https://donate.nami.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The NAMI,</b></a> <a href="https://eji.org/?campaign=447413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Equal Justice Initiative,</b></a> <a href="https://jedfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Jed Foundation,</b></a> <a href="https://www.stjude.org/donate/donate-to-st-jude.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>St. Jude's,</b></a> or <a href="https://donate.catf.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Clean Air Task Force.</b></a> These are 5 organizations that I believe are trying to help people today or shape a brighter future for the world tomorrow.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The remaining 60% of charitable funds will be decided by a Dice Breakers member vote. Members can discuss and promote their favorite charities from January through November. Then in December, a list of the top ranked charities will be published and members will be alloted votes equal to the number of dollars spent at Dice Breakers throughout the year. Polling will remain open until the third Friday in December, then the results are tallied and funds are distributed accordingly.</li>
