            I'm told I need more words on my home page to describe what this site is for, but I really like how clean it looks, so here is some comically small, white writing.
            I hope this makes the search engine overlords happy! Dice Breakers started as game I made up that used a google sheet and some dice to pick activities when friends and I were indecisive.
            Although I didn't call it "Dice Breakers" until recently. A friend suggested creating a list of prompts for sharing/getting to know friends better to add to the list of activities.
            Anyway, I couldn't sleep one morning and started writing questions to add to the game, then the name D(ice) Breakers came to mind. I guess I liked the name enough to develop it from a Google Sheets game to a website?
            I'll probably see about turning it into an app, too, although I'm not exactly a skilled programmer.	Do you think that's enough text to make search engines happy?
            I promise I'm a real website. My goal is to help inspire positive, thought provoking, or otherwise meaningful conversations. In person or online, whatever works to get people to connect and think a little bit more!
            Please, share this game with your friends! I'm going to try and update/add to the prompts regularly. And hopefully, eventually, this website is known to people outside my family and prompts are generated more organically.
            I'll admit I had to borrow from ChatGPT. AI is crazy. I prefer the human-generated prompts my friends and I have come up with more than the AI ones, but I can't deny it really helped me get this off the ground faster.
            So, like I said previously, this website is for general talking, conversations, rants, questions, activity ideas, and lots more. I have lots of ideas, hopefully I can make them real!
